## Hid3x

This tweak hides the [H3lix](https://h3lix.tihmstar.net), [Yalu102](https://yalu.qwertyoruiop.com), [Ph≈ìnix](https://phoenixpwn.com), [mach_portal](https://yalu.qwertyoruiop.com/), [extra_recipe](https://yalu.qwertyoruiop.com/) and [LiberiOS](http://newosxbook.com/liberios) offical icons while jailbroken.

At this time LiberiOS does not have substrate working, so this tweak will not work, until it's updated.

Please feel make a pull request will any additional jailbreak apps you'd like included.
